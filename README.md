# TODO-LIST-App

this is a flask application made with python ,html and flask module.
REMEMBER THIS IS A LOCAL HOST SERVER PROJECT. 

to run this application you must use PYCHARM and create (venv) and install Flask, BeautifulSoup
                           or
you need to install pip,Flask and bs4 packages to run the app.
Thankyou!
